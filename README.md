This project is the final assignment for the Web Design II (Responsive Design with Bootstrap) course. The course mainly focused on the principles of responsive web design.
 In this project, SASS was used instead of plain CSS, as it provides more powerful features such as variables, nesting, and mixins, which make the code easier to maintain, more organized, and scalable for larger projects.
